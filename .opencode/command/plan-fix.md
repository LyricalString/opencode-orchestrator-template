## Instructions

1. **Read the existing PLAN file** to understand investigation findings
2. Review against codebase patterns in AGENTS.md:
   - Data-fetching patterns (React Query)
   - Mutation patterns (cache invalidation)
   - Service layer patterns (ApiResponse, authenticatedClient)
   - Component patterns (forms, state management)
3. Create a detailed implementation plan with:
   - Specific files to modify
   - Code changes needed
   - Order of operations (parallel vs sequential)
   - Testing checklist
4. **Update the PLAN file** with the complete implementation plan
5. Present the plan for my approval

Do NOT implement yet - only plan.
