## Instructions

1. **Create a PLAN file** if one doesn't exist for this task
2. Create a TodoWrite list to track each issue/area to investigate
3. Launch **parallel explore agents** for each independent investigation
4. Act as orchestrator - synthesize all findings
5. **DO NOT make any code changes** - this is read-only investigation
6. Update the PLAN file with all findings

When complete, summarize:

- Root causes found
