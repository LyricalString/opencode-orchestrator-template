subtask: false

Load the `orchestrator-workflow` skill and process the following client feedback.

## Client Feedback

$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Follow the orchestrator workflow protocol:

1. **Create a PLAN file** (e.g., `FEEDBACK_PLAN.md`) to track this task
2. **Phase 1: Investigation** - Launch parallel explore agents to investigate each issue
3. **Phase 2: Planning** - Create detailed implementation plan aligned with codebase patterns
4. **Phase 3: Implementation** - Execute with coordinated agents

Keep the PLAN file updated throughout. If I need to leave, I should be able to return and say "continue from FEEDBACK_PLAN.md".

Start with Phase 1 now.
